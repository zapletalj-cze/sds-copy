> Great work! It is clear that you went way beyond the expectations and spent a lot of time analysing the elections. If I were strict, I would ask you to move the pre-processing code to its own notebook to keep the "essay" cleaner but that is a too minor note. The models could be more "spatially aware" at least in their evaluation.
